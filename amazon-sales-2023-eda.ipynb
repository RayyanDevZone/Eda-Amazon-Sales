    "### ***Exploring the Amazon Sales Dataset - 2023 involves a step-by-step process. First,we join the dataset as its fragmented based on categories, then we clean and prepare the data to ensure it's accurate and consistent. Then, we summarize the data using descriptive statistics like averages and ranges. Next, we visualize the data with charts and graphs to see patterns and relationships. We detect outliers, which are unusual data points, and test our assumptions about the data. We divide the data into groups for better understanding and finally, we summarize our findings and answers some business questions.*** "
